Personally, I feel that python is the best language to work with, but I can code in other languages as well.
I love working with frameworks such as FlasK and Django. 
I also have knowledge in Keras and Tensorflow using which I can develop and train models using python.
 
Some of the prjects I've worked on are: 
 1. Custom notepad applications build on python (you can add your own font too!)
 2. Data Analysis and Data visualization of the Indian Premier League (IPL) from 2008 to 2019.

Currently I'm working on a project to visualize the data of Formula-1 seasons from 1950 to 2021.


Skills: PYTHON / C / JAVA / HTML / CSS
